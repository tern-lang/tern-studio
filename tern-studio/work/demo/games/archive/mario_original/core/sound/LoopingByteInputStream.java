/**
 *  LoopingByteInputStream.java
 * 
 *  The LoopingByteInputStream is a ByteArrayInputStream that
 *  loops indefinitly. The looping stops when the close() method is called.
 *     
 *  Notice: this class extends the normal ByteArrayInputStream. We override the
 *  read method to make it continually read over and over until close() is called.
 *     
 *  In the SimpleSoundPlayer, if we create our stream as a looping stream instead
 *  of a normal one, we will continually replay the sound instead of playing it once.
 *
