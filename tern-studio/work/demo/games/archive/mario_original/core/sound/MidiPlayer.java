/**
 * MidiPlayer.java
 * See MidiTest2.java to easily see how to use this object
 * See MidiTest1.java for a more complex application using a meta event
 * 
 * The Java Sound API provides MIDI sound capabilities. To play MIDI music, you need two
 * objects: Sequence and Sequencer. A Sequence object contains the MIDI data, and a
 * Sequencer sends a Sequence to the MIDI synthesizer.
 * 
 * Generally, playing a MIDI file looks something like this:
 * Sequence sequence = MidiSystem.getSequence(new File(filename));
 * Sequencer sequencer = MidiSystem.getSequencer();
 * sequencer.open();
 * sequencer.setSequence(sequence);
 * sequencer.start();
 * 
 * By default, the Sequencer plays a Sequence once and then stops. To loop a 
 * Sequence, you need to be notified when the music is done playing and start over.
 * This is done with a MetaEventListener.
 *
